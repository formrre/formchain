# formchain
This code is going to be based on nanochain and ethereum source codes and its aims are 3-fold:
1. formal verification of simple system with parametrized proofs relying on security of certain cryptographic primitives and a simple non-turing complete scripting language in LiquidHaskell
2. adaptation of the system to a turing-complete Ethereum-style system
3. Ethereum-inspired modular approach i.e. if proof holds for a parametric consensus engine it also holds for the whole system

#### License
As the project is going to progress the parts, from which the source code comes, will be documented and the LICENSE will be appropriately updated, under the current plan it means GPLv3.
